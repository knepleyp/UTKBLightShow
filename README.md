# UTKBLightShow
UT plugin for cool lights with a Logitech Orion Spark G910

Requires the LED SDK from http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/developers

I used http://www.logitech.com/pub/techsupport/SDK/LEDSDK_8.58.12.zip , but that is subject to change.

Place the KBLightShow folder into the UnrealTournament/Plugins folder
Copy the LogitechLEDLib.h header into KBLightShow/Source/Private
Copy the x64 and x86 library directories from the sdk into KBLightShow/Source/lib
